# Proposal: IntelliCareer

## Introduction

IntelliCareer is an AI-powered job-seeking platform designed to revolutionize the way individuals approach their career search. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence, it offers personalized resume critiques, precise job matching, and actionable career advice. Its unique selling proposition lies in its ability to significantly enhance job search efficiency and accuracy, providing a tailored experience for each user's career aspirations.

## Objective

The original and novel goal of IntelliCareer is to address the inefficiencies and inaccuracies inherent in traditional job-searching methods. By utilizing cutting-edge AI technology, it aims to streamline the job search process, ensure more precise job-seeker-to-position matches, and support continuous career development, filling a critical gap in the job market landscape.

## Proposed Solution

IntelliCareer is conceived as an innovative job-seeking platform that fundamentally transforms the traditional approach to finding and filling job vacancies. At its core, the application is structured around three main components: the Home Page, the Discovery Page, and the Profile Page, each designed to offer a unique set of functionalities tailored to the needs of job seekers and employers alike.

### Home Page

This is the entry point of IntelliCareer, featuring an advertisement carousel that showcases various job opportunities and highlights. It also presents recent news related to recruitment and job market trends, keeping users informed about the latest developments in their industry or field of interest.

### Discovery Page

The heart of IntelliCareer, where the magic of job discovery happens. Users navigate this space to explore job listings. The application leverages Llama 2, an advanced language model, to intelligently match job seekers with suitable openings. By extracting keywords from users' resumes, it efficiently queries and identifies job positions that align with their skills, experience, and career aspirations. This smart match service ensures a highly personalized job search experience, significantly improving the relevance and precision of job recommendations.

### Profile Page

Here, users can upload their resumes to receive constructive feedback from the AI. The Llama 2 model evaluates the resumes in-depth, identifying areas for improvement and suggesting enhancements to increase their appeal to potential employers. Additionally, this page serves as a hub for users to either publish new job positions or manage their existing postings, facilitating a seamless recruitment process.
